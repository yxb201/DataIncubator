# Data Incubator Project Proposal

## Motivation
On each day, it is estimated that more than 400,000 thousand taxi-rides are taken by New Yorkers, creating an enormous amount of trip data that symbolize the heartbeat of the Big Apple. Since the public release of the TLC trip record data, there have been many analyses from the policy-making perspective, primarily focusing on understanding and improving the traffic congestion in the Greater New York Area. Others are interested in how the data can benefit the daily riders, providing services such as tips for cab hailing in Manhattan. For my Data Incubator project, I would like to focus on the standpoint of a yellow cab driver and to answer the question “What passenger-seeking strategy should I adopt to maximize my daily revenue?” This idea is motivated by the observation that, Uber drivers are aided by a mobile app that helps them to identify the next trip, while the vast majority of cab drivers rely on their own experience which can take a long time to build up.  With the tens of millions of trip data available, I am able to dig in deep and quantitatively answer questions such as which neighborhoods have the highest probability of picking up a passenger between 10am-11am, what is the average trip time from Midtown to lower Manhattan between 2pm-3pm, what is the likelihood of getting a high-fare trip at the JFK airport.
